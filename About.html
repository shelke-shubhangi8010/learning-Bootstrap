                <p>
                    Pratapgad is a mountain fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra.
                    The fort is situated 24 kilometres from the Mahabaleshwar hill station. The fort is now a tourist
                    destination.The fort's historical significance is due to the Battle of Pratapgad, which took place
                    here on 10 November 1659, between Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Bijapur Sultanate general Afzal
                    Khan.[3][4] The fort was constructed on a hilltop, about 1,080 meters above sea level, with views of
                    the surrounding landscapes. There are two main entrances to the fort, and the fort's gates are
                    protected by high walls.It is divided into two parts the lower fort and the upper fort. At present,
                    the lower fort houses the main entrance, while the upper fort contains temples, a modern statue of
                    Shivaji Maharaj, and several buildings. The fort has several watch towers and bastion for providing
                    strategic military advantages during its time of use.

                <p>
                    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, founder of Maratha Empire, in Western India in 1664, was well known for
                    his forts. He was in possession of around 370 forts at the time of his death. Many, like Panhala
                    Fort and Rajgad existed before him, like Sindhudurg and his Pratapgad, were built by him from
                    scratches. The fort of Raigad was built as the place of his throne, i.e. the capital, of Maratha
                    Empire by Hirojee Indulkar on the orders of Shivaji. This is the place where Shivaji was crowned and
                    today also his Samadhi stands in front of the Jagadishwar temple.

                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>
                    Pratapgad Fort's "mission" is rooted in its historical significance as a key Maratha fort,
                    particularly for its role in the legendary Battle of Pratapgad. The fort's construction, ordered by
                    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was strategically designed to control the Par Pass and the Nira and
                    Koyna rivers. However, it's the 1659 Battle of Pratapgad, where Shivaji's forces defeated Afzal
                    Khan, that cemented the fort's place in Maratha history.

                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>
                    Pratapgad Fort is deeply tied to the legacy of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Built in 1656 by
                    Moropant Trimbak Pingle, one of Shivajiâ€™s ministers, the fort was constructed to oversee the Par
                    Pass and safeguard the empire from enemy invasions. However, it rose to prominence in 1659 due to
                    the iconic battle between Shivaji and Afzal Khan, a general of the Adil Shahi.
